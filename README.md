# dotscience-tf

## 1. deploy the stack

edit variables.tf and set `dotscience_hub_ssh_key` and `dotscience_hub_admin_password`

Deploy the stack:
```
terraform apply -auto-approve || (sleep 30; terraform apply -auto-approve)
```

The ugly sleep & retry hopefully won't be necessary once [https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/pull/639](this PR) makes it into a stable release.

## 2. connect eks cluster as dotscience deployer

TODO: all of this should be automated... maybe by shelling out to `ds` command to add managed deployer.

Grab the login URL and open it in a browser:
```
terraform show |grep '"LoginURL" = "'
```

Log in (using `admin` and the password you set in step 1) and let's set up the EKS cluster.

Click "â‰¡" and "Deployers".
Add new deployer, name it "EKS" or whatever.

Record the command in the deployer settings, which we'll call `<command>` below.

Identify the `kubeconfig` file terraform creates locally:

```
ls kubeconfig*
```

Prepare the following command:

```
KUBECONFIG=<kubeconfig> <command>
```

Before running it, make the following changes to `<command>`:
* add `&notls=true` at the end of the URL
* add quotes around the entire URL

The deployer should go green in the Dotscience web interface.
